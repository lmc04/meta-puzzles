# Meta Coding Puzzles

My attempts at Meta's publicly available coding puzzles. More will be added as they are completed.

These are organized by level, i.e. `L0` means Level 0, `L1` means Level 1, etc. The questions are included as screenshots, while the answers are in python. The separate attempts included run correctly, but do not run fast enough to pass the test cases on time.
